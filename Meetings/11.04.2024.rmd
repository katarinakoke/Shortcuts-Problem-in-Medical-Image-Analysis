# Meeting Notes: 26.02.2024 - Meeting with Amelia

### Questions for Amelia:

- The datasets all have close to 30 thousand:
    - Random: 60/40 for gender and 8/92 for pneumothorax
    - Balanced: 50/50 for gender and 50/50 for pneumothorax
    - Biased: 80/20 for gender and 50/50 for pneumothorax
    
    â†’ our idea is to have the random represent the true distribution of the data, while the balanced and biased are arbitrarily  made. biased still has 50/50 for pneumothorax since we want to check how **only** gender impacts the performance/fairness
    
- we used to only delete patients with the same id, but now we first do group shuffle to minimize this loss
- we are doing 5 different lambda values (including baseline) and then changing seeds. currently we have to seed 2 (most of the experiments) and plan to have seed 4
- For chest drains, we have made the datasets - but the true unknown distribution is a problem
    - how did she do it for her paper, where could we find such information about the true distribution
- We are planning to use AUC and Precision-Recall Curve, to measure the performance of the main task
- Fairness: *read first*
- more experiments: what are shortcuts? improve the conclusion by experimenting more on shortcuts - the trade off between accuracy and performance


### NOTES: 

- Look into other metrics : 
    - Review of metrics
    - Fairness: group performance
    - Equalised Odds is good for our fairness

### IDEAS:

- Train the model without the sensitive attribute head, and fine-tune with the annotations for chest drains
- Train the model by combining the 3 different datasets (PADCHEST, NIH, CheXpert)
- Skin lesion dataset
