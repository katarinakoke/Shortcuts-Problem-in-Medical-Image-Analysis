# Meeting Notes: 13.02.2024 - Data preparation

### What Was Done:

- After reviewing potential datasets, we decided to proceed with **the CheXpert dataset** for our project, valuing its comprehensive nature and relevance to our goals.
- Attempted to download the CheXpert dataset but faced challenges due to its large size (471 GB).

### What We Learned:

- **Overview of potential datasets**:
    - Explored various sources for medical imaging datasets, such as Papers with Code and the Stanford AIMI repository, comparing options before settling on CheXpert.
    - **CheXpert details**:
        - Found through the Stanford ML Group and available for download via the Stanford AIMI website.
        - Includes extensive documentation and a GitHub repository for test set labels, highlighting its well-supported nature.
        - Comprises images labeled across 14 different categories, offering a broad spectrum for analysis and model training.

- **Project outline update**:
    - **Current plan**: Short-circuit testing (ShorT) to identify presence of shortcuts, followed by CycleGAN for image modification, culminating in the development of a final classifier aimed at ensuring model fairness.
    - **Goal**: To detect and mitigate shortcut learning within the dataset, thereby enhancing the fairness and accuracy of our model.

### What to Do Next:

- **Dataset challenges**:
    - Prepare a set of questions for Amelia regarding the best approach to handle the CheXpert dataset's large size:
        1. **Data subset**: Discuss the feasibility and implications of working with a smaller subset of the CheXpert dataset to manage size constraints.
        2. **Cloud**: Explore the possibility of using Microsoft Azure for data storage and processing, including clarifying financial responsibilities (personal vs. ITU funding).
        3. **ITU Resources**: Investigate if there are available resources at ITU, such as dedicated computers for data-intensive projects, for us to utilize.

- **Next steps planning**:
    - Schedule a meeting with Amelia to discuss the outlined questions and decide how to handle the dataset.
    - Depending on the outcome of the discussion with Amelia, revise the project timeline to accommodate any changes in dataset preparation and initial analysis phases.
