# Meeting Notes: 12.02.2024 - CycleGANs

### What Was Done:

- **Developed and shared a Notion page** for organizing our meeting summaries and notes on readings, creating a repository for project documentation.
- **Continued our exploration of GANs** by focusing on conditional GANs, with a specific emphasis on CycleGANs. This included:
    - Watching an explanatory video about CycleGANs and their GitHub implementation, to gain an understanding of their architecture and applications.

### What We Learned:

1. **CycleGANs overview and implementation strategy:**
   
    - **Key steps for using CycleGANs in medical imaging**:
        - Dataset collection with specific criteria (e.g., chest X-rays with and without drains) to ensure model effectiveness.
        - Data preprocessing including normalization and augmentation, with care taken not to introduce medically implausible features.
        - Detailed architecture planning for CycleGANs, emphasizing the importance of choosing the right loss functions and training parameters to achieve realistic image translation without loss of critical information.
        - Considerations for model training, including batch size, learning rate, and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
        - Strategies for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated images, ensuring the removal of drains does not compromise medical accuracy.
        - The necessity of post-processing steps to ensure generated images meet the diagnostic quality standards of chest X-rays.
        - Utilization of code libraries and frameworks, with a recommendation for TensorFlow or PyTorch, and the suggestion to adapt existing CycleGAN implementations.

2. **Current project direction and decisions:**
    - Discussed the use of CheXpert or other datasets for our project, but we need to **finalize our dataset choice** to progress.
    - Discussed testing existing **algorithms for shortcut learning** with an interestnig paper on this topic, called "Detecting shortcut learning for fair medical AI using shortcut testing".
    - Concluded that **CycleGAN’s** ability to modify existing images makes it an optimal choice for us.

### What to Do Next:

- Conduct a thorough review of potential datasets, including CheXpert, to determine the best fit for our project’s goals.
- Continue to deepen our understanding of CycleGANs and related technologies by exploring more literature, tutorials, and case studies. This will also include studying the impact of GANs on medical image analysis and any potential ethical implications.
- Outline a detailed plan for the initial phase of algorithm testing.
