# Meeting Notes: 06.02.2024 - Project Kickoff Meeting

### What Was Done:

- **Held our first official project meeting** to discuss the foundational knowledge required for our project, focusing on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
- **Reviewed key resources** to gain an understanding of GANs:
    - An introductory article on GANs from Machine Learning Mastery, providing a basic overview and explanation of GANs.
    - The original GAN paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) for a technical deep dive into the algorithms that pioneered this field.
    - A recent MICCAI paper titled "Right for the Wrong Reasons" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12344), discussing potential pitfalls in GAN applications and how to avoid them.
- **Established a shared Notion page** for collaborative note-taking and resource sharing to facilitate ongoing project documentation and communication.

### What We Learned:

- **Gained a preliminary understanding of GANs**, including their structure (generator and discriminator models), functionality, and potential applications in our project.
- **Identified the importance of a thorough understanding of GANs** to avoid common pitfalls, such as model overfitting or generating misleading results, as highlighted in the MICCAI paper.
- **Recognized the need for deeper exploration** of the subject matter to fully grasp the concepts and methodologies described in the discussed papers.

### What to Do Next:

- **Revisit and study the provided resources in-depth** to ensure a comprehensive understanding of GANs and their application to our project.
- **Expand our literature review** to include additional papers and resources related to GANs, focusing on those relevant to our project's specific goals and challenges.
- **Schedule a follow-up meeting** to discuss our findings from the additional literature review, address any questions or uncertainties, and outline the next steps in our project's development.
- **Continue to update and maintain the shared Notion page**, ensuring it remains a central hub for project documentation, resource sharing, and collaborative discussion.
