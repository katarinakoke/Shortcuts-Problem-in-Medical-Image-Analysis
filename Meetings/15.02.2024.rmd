# Meeting Notes: 15.02.2024 - Meeting with Amelia

### What Was Done:

- **Introduced Our Thesis Project**: Presented our project and reviewed the proposal with Amelia, ensuring she understood our goals, methodology, and expected outcomes.
- **Received Commitments from Amelia**:
    - Amelia agreed to enhance our project by:
        - Providing a new research paper to deepen our understanding and offer fresh perspectives.
        - Sharing her own code, which is closely aligned with our project's objectives, to aid in our development.
        - Facilitating access to computational resources by advocating for our use of the necessary computing cluster.

### What We Learned:

- **Valuable Resources and Support**: Amelia's contributions, including the forthcoming research paper and her code, will be instrumental in advancing our project. Her support in accessing computational resources underscores the importance of leveraging institutional resources for project success.
- **The Importance of Documentation**: The meeting highlighted the need for meticulous documentation of our project's progress, decisions, and changes. This is crucial not only for internal clarity and organization but also for fulfilling academic requirements and ensuring transparency.

### What to Do Next:

- **Immediate Actions**:
    - **Set Up a GitHub Repository**: Establish a repository to house our project's documentation, code, and progress updates. This will serve as the central hub for all project-related materials and facilitate collaboration.
    - **Consult SAP for Proposal Adjustments**: Reach out to SAP to discuss potential adjustments to our thesis proposal. This conversation will be guided by the new insights from Amelia and the research paper she provides, ensuring our project remains flexible and responsive to new information.
    - **Start Documentation on GitHub**: Begin the process of documenting our meetings, decisions, and project progress in a markdown file within our GitHub repository. This will help us keep track of our project's evolution and make information easily accessible to all team members and advisors.

- **Long-term Planning**:
    - **Review and Incorporate Amelia's Inputs**: Once Amelia shares the research paper and her code, review these resources thoroughly to identify how they can be integrated into our project. This may involve adjusting our methodology, experimenting with new techniques, or reevaluating our project timeline.
    - **Secure Computational Resources**: Follow up on Amelia's request for access to the computing cluster to ensure we have the necessary infrastructure in place to begin our data analysis and model training phases.
    - **Continuous Documentation and Review**: Keep the GitHub repository up to date with regular entries and updates. Plan for periodic reviews of our documentation to ensure that it accurately reflects our project's current status and incorporates any new insights or changes.
